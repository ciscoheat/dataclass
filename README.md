An empty Haxe/Node.js project, to get started quickly.

A common first usage setup after cloning the repo:

```
renameproject nodeproject my-project-name
npm install -g nodemon
haxe my-project-name.hxml
npm start
```

`renameproject.bat` which is used to rename the project uses `fnr.exe` which is a rather large .exe file, remove it if you don't need it. A nice contribution would be to make a Haxe file that does the same.
