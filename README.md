An empty Haxe/Neko project, to get started quickly.

A common first usage setup after cloning the repo:

```
renameproject my-project-name
haxe my-project-name.hxml
neko bin/my-project-name.n
```

`renameproject.bat` which is used to rename the project uses `fnr.exe` which is a rather large .exe file, they are both deleted after renaming. A nice contribution would be to make a Haxe file that does the same.
